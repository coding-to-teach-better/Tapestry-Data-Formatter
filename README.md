# Tapestry-Data-Formatter
# Tapestry is a learning journal application used by primary schools.
# At the time this was created (one year ago) data couldn't be selected by specific assessment within tapestry
# Here I have created a short function to format a dataset downloaded from tapestry (namely the pupil observation counts per learning area)
# the function should select assessment data that meets the criteria inputted by the user
